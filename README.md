# Classification-Algorithm-Analysis-on-Twitter-Tweets
 
In this project, the twitter tweets were taken as documents and they are preprocessed by Tokenizing, Lemmatization and Stemming. The preprocessed documents are vectorized with keywords as attributes. The range of values would be between 0 and 1 denoting the absence and presence of that word in a single document. The rows denotes each document and the column denotes the presence of words in the document.

The classification algorithms used here are : 1. Support Vector Machine 2. K - Nearest Neighbours 3. Naive Bayesian Classifier 4. Decision Trees.

We have analysed the accuracy of each and every classification Algorithm before and after the dimensionality reduction. The dimensionality reduction techniques used here is 1. Principal Component Analysis .   

I have uploaded a pdf file along which will have the entire idea about how the project looks like.
